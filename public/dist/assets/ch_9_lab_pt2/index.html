        <p>I am very pleased to announce Sony is officially partnering with Samsung to give you the SamSony Fax Machine.
          Coming to a RadioShack near you. You can preorder them now by Mapquesting directions to your local Blockbuster
          and then texting 2122 to 53079 to vote for Kelly Clarkson on American Idol. Is that enough old references to
          fill up the Aside element? I guess we shall find out when I try to make this page work.</p>

            <h4>The company was incorporated by Ibuka Masaru and Morita Akio in 1946 as Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo (“Tokyo
              Telecommunications Engineering Corporation”). Ibuka, whose Japan Precision Instruments Company had
              supplied
              electronic devices during World War II, and Morita, an applied sciences instructor, had met during World
              War
              II as engineers designing heat-seeking missiles for the Imperial Japanese Army. Ibuka and Morita worked
              together for the next 40 years in what has been called one of “business history’s most productive and
              intriguing relationships.”</h4>

            <h4>Ibuka’s genius with product development and Morita’s mastery of business management and marketing
              turned Sony into one of the most renowned brand names on the globe. Sony, which became the official name
              for
              the company in January 1958, was derived from the Latin sonus (“sound”) and was conceived to be an
              international and not a Japanese term.</h4>

            <h4>The early 1990s were difficult years for Sony. The Japanese economy entered a decadelong recession,
              and
              both Ibuka and Morita suffered strokes (in 1992 and 1993, respectively). Morita officially retired in 1994
              and
              died in 1999. With its founders no longer at the controls, Sony declared its first loss, more than $200
              million, in 1993. Despite the business turmoil, Sony continued to design and deliver new products. In 1994
              its
              entertainment division introduced its PlayStation video game console to the Japanese market. By 2002 the
              game
              unit was contributing more than 10 percent of the company’s yearly revenues.</h4>
